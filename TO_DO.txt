Other:
   	- add user and admin accounts... try to fake inheritance (interface?)

Build Account Menus (STARTED):
    - fill out functions to edit name (DONE), address (DONE), and birthday in menus (accounts.go)
    - add save for changes made to the account in the menu (STARTED)
        - right now AccountMainMenu updates the client that it is run on
        - if now the account list needs to be updated with the new version of that account before saved at end of AccountMainMenu

Move Most of Main into App
    - create a function called Run()
        - from there call StartUp
        - from there work with client account
        - maybe do the accountlist load/save from Run() as well
    - main only calls Run()
